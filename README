make  creates the directory bin, with executable simint, which can be
      run either in interactive mode, by typing "simint" with no
      arguments, or "simint scriptname" to run in non-interactive
      mode, where scriptname is the name of a valid TCL command
      script, an example of which is in example.tcl

If your pgplot libraries of header files are installed in a directory
other than /usr/local/pgplot, you'll have to hand-edit Makefile to
change the cariables:

       PGINCDIR -- The directory where pgplot header files are located

and/or

       PGLIBDIR -- The directory where pgplot libraries are located

to reflect your setup.
